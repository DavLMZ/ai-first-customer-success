# QBR Preparation — AI-Assisted Narrative Generation

> Reduce QBR prep from 3-5 hours to 30 minutes with AI-generated narratives and data packs.

## The Problem

QBR preparation is one of the highest time sinks in Customer Success. CSMs spend hours pulling data from multiple systems, crafting narratives, building slides, and rehearsing talking points — often for meetings that get rescheduled or cut short.

The insight: **80% of QBR prep is data gathering and synthesis. AI handles that. The CSM's job is the 20% — strategic framing, relationship nuance, and executive judgment.**

## QBR Prep Workflow: Before & After

### Before (Traditional)
| Step | Time | Activity |
|------|------|----------|
| 1 | 45 min | Pull usage data from product analytics |
| 2 | 30 min | Review support tickets and satisfaction scores |
| 3 | 30 min | Check CRM for engagement history and notes |
| 4 | 45 min | Write narrative and talking points |
| 5 | 60 min | Build/update slide deck |
| 6 | 30 min | Internal alignment with AE/leadership |
| **Total** | **4+ hours** | |

### After (AI-Assisted)
| Step | Time | Activity |
|------|------|----------|
| 1 | 10 min | Feed data into AI prompt, generate narrative draft |
| 2 | 10 min | Review and personalise AI output with CSM judgment |
| 3 | 5 min | Auto-generate slide deck from template + data |
| 4 | 5 min | Quick internal sync with key talking points |
| **Total** | **30 minutes** | |

**Time saved per QBR: ~3.5 hours.** For a CSM running 15-20 QBRs per quarter, that's 50-70 hours reclaimed for strategic work.

## Best Practices

1. **Always add the human layer** — AI generates the foundation, but the CSM adds context only they know: relationship dynamics, unspoken concerns, political landscape
2. **Customise by audience** — A QBR for a technical champion looks different from one for a CFO. Adjust the prompt to reflect who's in the room
3. **Use QBRs as expansion vehicles** — Every QBR should include a forward-looking section that plants seeds for growth conversations
4. **Record and learn** — Feed QBR outcomes back into the system. Which talking points resonated? Which recommendations were accepted? This trains better future preparation
