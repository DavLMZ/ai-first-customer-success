# Account Research — Pre-Meeting Intelligence Prompts

> Walk into every customer conversation fully prepared in 10 minutes, not 2 hours.

## The Principle

The best CSMs don't just know their product — they know their customer's business, industry, and strategic priorities well enough to be a credible advisor. The problem is that this level of preparation traditionally requires hours of research.

AI collapses that research into minutes, freeing CSMs to focus on *what to do with the intelligence* rather than *gathering it*.

## Prompt Templates

### 1. New Account Deep Dive

Use before first engagement with a new customer.

```
Research the following company and prepare an account intelligence brief:

Company: [name]
Industry: [sector]
Website: [URL]
Key contact: [name, title]

Generate:
1. **Company Overview** — What they do, size, market position (3-4 sentences)
2. **Strategic Priorities** — Based on recent news, earnings, press releases: 
   what are their top business priorities right now?
3. **Technology Landscape** — What's known about their tech stack, 
   digital transformation status, and relevant vendor relationships?
4. **Industry Context** — Top 3 challenges facing their industry that our 
   product could address
5. **Key Stakeholders** — Based on LinkedIn/public info: who are the likely 
   decision-makers and influencers for [product category]?
6. **Conversation Starters** — 3 insights or questions that would demonstrate 
   business acumen and open a strategic dialogue
7. **Risk Factors** — Any red flags (layoffs, M&A rumours, leadership changes) 
   that could affect the engagement

Keep the brief to one page. Prioritise actionable intelligence over 
comprehensive background.
```

### 2. Pre-Meeting Refresh

Use before any scheduled customer meeting (15 min prep).

```
I have a meeting with [contact name, title] at [company] in [timeframe].

Context:
- Last interaction: [date, summary]
- Current health score: [score]
- Open action items: [list]
- Upcoming renewal/milestone: [details]

Based on this context, provide:
1. **Talking points** — 3 key topics to cover, prioritised by importance
2. **Questions to ask** — 2-3 strategic questions that show I understand 
   their business
3. **Risks to address** — Any concerns I should proactively raise
4. **Value reinforcement** — One specific outcome or win to highlight
5. **Next step suggestion** — What should I propose as the logical next action?

Format as a quick-reference card I can review in 5 minutes before the call.
```

### 3. Executive Meeting Preparation

Use before C-suite or VP-level meetings where strategic credibility matters most.

```
I'm meeting with [name], [title] at [company]. This is an executive-level 
conversation where I need to demonstrate strategic partnership, not just 
product support.

Company context: [brief summary]
Meeting purpose: [objective]
Relationship history: [summary of past interactions]

Prepare:
1. **Executive-level opening** — A business-relevant observation that 
   demonstrates I understand their strategic context (not a product pitch)
2. **Industry benchmark** — One relevant data point comparing their 
   performance/adoption to industry peers
3. **Strategic alignment** — How our product connects to their stated 
   business priorities (use their language, not ours)
4. **Provocative question** — One thought-provoking question that positions 
   me as a strategic advisor, not a vendor
5. **The ask** — What specific commitment or next step should I be driving toward?
6. **Objection preparation** — 2-3 likely pushbacks with recommended responses

Tone: Peer-to-peer, business-focused, confident but not pushy.
```

### 4. Competitive Intelligence Quick Brief

Use when a customer mentions a competitor or you detect evaluation signals.

```
A customer in [industry] has mentioned [competitor name] in recent conversations.

Our product: [brief description]
Their current usage: [summary]
Contract details: [value, renewal date]

Provide:
1. **Competitor positioning** — How [competitor] positions against us: 
   their strengths and messaging
2. **Our differentiation** — 3 concrete points where we're stronger, 
   with evidence or proof points
3. **Their weaknesses** — Known limitations or common complaints 
   about [competitor]
4. **Talking points** — How to address the competitive conversation 
   without being defensive
5. **Retention strategy** — Specific actions to reinforce our value and 
   increase switching costs

Important: Focus on our strengths, not competitor bashing. 
The goal is to make the customer feel confident in their choice.
```

## Usage Tips

- **Layer your own context** — These prompts generate a starting point. Always add relationship nuance, internal politics, and qualitative context that only you know
- **Feed back outcomes** — After meetings, note which talking points resonated. Over time, you'll refine which prompts and angles work best for different personas
- **Share with your team** — Standardising account research prompts across the CS team ensures consistent preparation quality regardless of CSM experience level
- **Update regularly** — Customer situations change. Re-run research prompts quarterly or when major account events occur
