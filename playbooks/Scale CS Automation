# Scale CS Automation: AI-Driven Workflows for Portfolio Coverage

> How to deliver personalised, proactive customer success at scale — without proportionally scaling headcount.

## The Scale CS Challenge

Every CS leader faces the same math problem: you have hundreds (or thousands) of customers, a finite team, and the expectation that *every* customer receives a great experience. Traditional approaches force a binary choice — high-touch for top accounts, near-zero touch for the rest.

AI breaks this trade-off. The goal isn't "automated CS" — it's **augmented CS at scale**, where technology handles the repeatable while humans handle the remarkable.

## The Automation Pyramid

```
         ┌─────────────┐
         │  STRATEGIC   │  ← Human-led: Executive engagement,
         │  (Top 10%)   │     complex negotiations, save plays
         ├─────────────┤
         │  GUIDED      │  ← AI-assisted: CSM uses AI for prep,
         │  (Next 20%)  │     analysis, follow-up. Human owns relationship
         ├─────────────┤
         │  SCALED      │  ← AI-led: Automated engagement with

         │  SELF-SERVE  │  ← Fully automated: Product-led engagement,

## Automated Workflow Playbooks

### 1. Onboarding Automation

**Trigger:** New customer contract signed  
**Goal:** Accelerate time-to-first-value without requiring 1:1 CSM onboarding

```
WORKFLOW:
Day 0    → Welcome email (personalised by use case + industry)
Day 1    → Account setup checklist (auto-generated based on purchased features)
Day 3    → "Getting started" content (curated by persona: admin vs. end user)
Day 7    → Setup completion check
           ├─ IF complete → Congratulations + next steps for advanced features
           └─ IF incomplete → Gentle nudge + offer of office hours / support
Day 14   → First usage milestone check
           ├─ IF active → Tips for deeper adoption + peer benchmarks
           └─ IF inactive → ESCALATE to CSM for personal outreach
Day 30   → Onboarding health check
           ├─ IF healthy → Transition to ongoing nurture sequence
           └─ IF at risk → ESCALATE to CSM with context brief
```

### 2. Ongoing Engagement Automation

**Trigger:** Customer past onboarding phase (Day 30+)  
**Goal:** Maintain engagement momentum and surface risks/opportunities

```
RECURRING WORKFLOWS:

Weekly:
  → Usage trend analysis (automated)
  → Anomaly detection: flag accounts with >20% usage decline

Monthly:
  → Automated health score refresh
  → Personalised product tips based on unused features
  → New feature announcements relevant to customer's use case

Quarterly:
  → Auto-generated business review summary (for scale accounts)
  → Benchmarking report: "Here's how you compare to peers in [industry]"
  → Renewal health pre-check (6 months before renewal)

Event-driven:
  → New feature launch → targeted notification to relevant accounts
  → Support ticket resolved → satisfaction pulse survey
  → Champion activity drop → alert CSM
  → Usage spike → expansion signal → alert CSM
  → Contract anniversary → value recap email
```

### 3. Renewal Automation

**Trigger:** 180 days before renewal date  
**Goal:** Ensure smooth renewals for healthy accounts, early intervention for at-risk

```
WORKFLOW:
Day -180  → Automated renewal health assessment
            ├─ IF healthy (score 80+) → Queue for automated renewal
            └─ IF at risk (score <80) → ESCALATE to CSM

Day -120  → For healthy accounts: value recap email
            "Here's what you've achieved this year..."
            
Day -90   → Renewal intent check (automated outreach)
            ├─ IF positive response → Initiate renewal process
            ├─ IF concerns raised → ESCALATE to CSM
            └─ IF no response → Follow-up sequence (x3 attempts)

Day -60   → For automated renewals: send renewal proposal
            For CSM-managed: ensure save plan in progress

Day -30   → Final renewal push
            ├─ IF signed → Welcome to renewal, onboarding refresh
            └─ IF unsigned → URGENT escalation to CS leadership

Day 0     → Renewal processed or churn logged with reason analysis
```

### 4. Expansion Signal Automation

**Trigger:** Various product and engagement signals  
**Goal:** Identify and surface expansion opportunities across the entire portfolio

```
SIGNALS MONITORED:

Usage-based:
  → Approaching licence limit (>80% utilisation) → alert CSM + AE
  → New department/team usage detected → cross-sell opportunity
  → API usage growing significantly → platform tier upgrade signal
  → Feature usage hitting plan limits → upsell trigger

Engagement-based:
  → Customer asks about features not in current plan → interest signal
  → Multiple users requesting same capability → demand signal
  → Customer referencing competitor features → competitive response needed

Business-based:
  → Company announces growth/funding → budget expansion likely
  → New executive joins customer → relationship opportunity
  → Industry regulation change → compliance feature relevance

FOR EACH SIGNAL:
  → Log opportunity in CRM
  → Generate expansion brief (context + recommended approach)
  → Route to appropriate owner (CSM or AE based on segment)
  → Track conversion rate by signal type (continuous improvement)
```

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-4)
- Map current customer journey touchpoints
- Identify highest-volume, lowest-judgment interactions
- Build email/notification templates for top 5 automated touchpoints
- Set up basic trigger logic in CS platform (Gainsight, Vitally, or equivalent)

### Phase 2: Core Automation (Weeks 5-8)
- Deploy onboarding automation sequence
- Launch ongoing engagement nurture tracks
- Implement usage anomaly detection alerts
- Build automated renewal health pre-checks

### Phase 3: Intelligence Layer (Weeks 9-12)

- Implement champion tracking and risk alerts
- Create automated business review summaries for scale accounts

### Phase 4: Optimise (Ongoing)
- A/B test messaging and cadence
- Measure impact: engagement rates, NRR by segment, time saved
- Refine trigger thresholds based on outcomes
- Expand automation to cover new customer segments

## Metrics That Matter

| Metric | Baseline (Manual) | Target (Automated) |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Scale account engagement rate | 20-30% | 70%+ |
| Time-to-first-value (onboarding) | 45-90 days | 20-40 days |
| Renewal rate (scale segment) | 75-80% | 88-92% |
| Expansion pipeline from scale accounts | Minimal | 15-20% of total |
| CSM time on admin/routine tasks | 60%+ | <25% |
| Accounts per CSM (scale tier) | 50-80 | 150-200 |

## The Principle

Scale CS automation isn't about removing the human from Customer Success. It's about ensuring that when a human *does* engage, it's because the situation genuinely requires human judgment, empathy, or strategic thinking — not because nobody set up the automated alternative.

The best scale CS programmes feel personal to the customer while being operationally efficient for the team.
